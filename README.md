Upon opening the app, it will take up to roughly 10 seconds for the app to pull the current price of Dogecoin from all the different exchanges. You'll see this happen when the prices change from "0.0" to something else. You can then click on one of the exchanges to see a graph of recent trades, displaying the price they went for and the time at which it happened. (NOTE: CoinedUp does not currently work. Still waiting on API access). We reccomend checking out the Bter graph. It takes a little longer to load, but their API provides a great base of information of recent trades. In the Settings menu, you can turn on ongoing notifications which will display the price of Dogecoin in microBTC for any echanges you choose. (NOTE: Currently only microBTC functions currently. Proer conversions need t o still be added for BTC and Satoshi).


Dogecoin Ticker was developed for anyone who owns Dogecoins. Knowing the current price of Dogecoins is key for any possessor of the Doge, and that is where Dogecoin Ticker comes in.


With Dogecoin Ticker, you can have access to clean and insightful graphs of the most popular Dogecoin exchanges along with many other cool features to help you keep track of Dogecoin's current price among these exchanges.
