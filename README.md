## About
Dogecoin Ticker was developed for anyone who owns Dogecoins. Knowing the current price of Dogecoins is key for any possessor of the Doge, and that is where Dogecoin Ticker comes in.


With Dogecoin Ticker, you can have access to clean and insightful graphs of the most popular Dogecoin exchanges along with many other cool features to help you keep track of Dogecoin's current price among these exchanges.

This app was created as a class project in Spring of 2014 and then cleaned up a bit after then released on the Android App store. Since its release it has been neglected a bit but now I have decided to make this repo public and hopefully encourage contributions from the community. I apologize in advance if some of the code isn't written as best as it could be but this was my first Android app so go easy on me/us. 

I welcome feedback, questions and pull requests. I will try to get a CI job set up soon for this repository.
